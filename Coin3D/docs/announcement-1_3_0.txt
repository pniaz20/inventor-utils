SoWin 1.3.0 Released
====================

Preamble
--------

The SoWin library is a C++ GUI toolkit that binds together the Coin
rendering library with the user interface parts of the MSWindows Win32
API, thereby providing application programmers a convenient method of
using the Coin library from MSWindows development environments.

Coin is a high-level 3D graphics library with a C++ Application
Programming Interface. Coin implements the SGI Open Inventor API.

New in this release
-------------------

* improved stereo support
* complete Visual Studio project file setup under build/
* SoWinGLWidget::setStealFocus()/isStealFocus()
* misc minor fixes

Download instructions
---------------------

We will regularly package up new bugfix releases of the SoWin library
into source code archives for distribution on the FTP site whenever we
feel this is justified by the number and/or severity of the fixed
bugs. This also goes for updated binary installation packages.
