SoWin 1.1.0 Released

We consider SoWin to be a release-quality codebase now, so we decided
to make the first interface-stable release. The version number has
been set to 1.1.0 because this release of SoWin has features not found
in SoQt 1.0, but that are in SoXt 1.1 and which will appear in the
future SoQt 1.1.  We want to try to keep version numbers and feature
sets synchronized between the various GUI-binding toolkits.

Below follows download instructions.

We will regularly package up new bugfix releases of the SoWin library
into source code archives for distribution on the FTP site whenever we
feel this is justified by the number and/or severity of the fixed
bugs.  This also goes for updated binary installation packages.

Precompiled for MS Windows:
  In the works, stay tuned.
