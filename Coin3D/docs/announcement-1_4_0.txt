SoWin 1.4.0 Released
====================

Preamble
--------

The SoWin library is a C++ GUI toolkit that binds together the Coin
rendering library with the user interface parts of the MSWindows Win32
API, thereby providing application programmers a convenient method of
using the Coin library from MSWindows development environments.

Coin is a high-level 3D graphics library with a C++ Application
Programming Interface. Coin implements the SGI Open Inventor API.

Download instructions
---------------------

into source code archives for distribution on the FTP site whenever we
feel this is justified by the number and/or severity of the fixed
bugs. This also goes for updated binary installation packages.
