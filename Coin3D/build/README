To compile SoWin, open the Visual Studio solution file from one of the
directories above and build the solution.

As part of the build process, the SoWin library is installed in the
COINDIR directory, so make sure you set the environment variable
COINDIR before attempting to build SoWin. If Coin is installed in
C:\Coin3D, COINDIR should be set to C:\Coin3D.
