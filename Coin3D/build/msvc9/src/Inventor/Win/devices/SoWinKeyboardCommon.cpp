  \class SoWinKeyboard SoWinKeyboard.h Inventor/Win/devices/SoWinKeyboard.h
  \brief The SoWinKeyboard class is the keyboard input device abstraction.

  \ingroup devices

  The SoWinKeyboard class is the glue between native keyboard
  handling and keyboard interaction with the Inventor scenegraph.

  All components derived from the SoWinRenderArea have got an
  SoWinKeyboard device attached by default.
