This folder contains a Visual Studio wizard that can be used to create new projects with SoWin.

The created projects will automatically add the needed include folders, library dependencies etc, as long as the COINDIR environment variable is set correctly.

Installing the SoWin project wizard:

Copy the two folders into the VC subfolder of your Visual Studio 9 install folder.
(default: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC).
