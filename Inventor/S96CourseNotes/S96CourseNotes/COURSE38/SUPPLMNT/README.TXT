The Inventor sub-directory includes executables and source code that accompany 

the siggraph96 courses 38 & 39: "Scene Modeling Tools in Open Inventor" 

and "Programming Animation and Interaction in Open Inventor".  


The executable demo programs included can be run on any Intel PC running 

either Microsoft Windows 95 (R) or Microsoft Windows NT (R).   Sorry, 

Windows 3.1 machines won't be able to run these programs (even with win32s).  


The programs can be run directly from the CD-ROM, or 

(for better performance) copied to your hard drive. The total size

is approximately 10 meg.


The demos look best when running under high (16 bits/pixel) or

true (24 bits/pixel) color resolution.  Use the Display applet in

the Windows Control panel to see/set the color resolution.


Before using the OLEDEMO applet, please run: OLEDEMO.REG.


For Windows 95 Users:

(Editor's note: To see the following files, you must have enabled 
"Show All Files" in the dialog box from Explorer's View/Options menu.)

Copy GLU32.DLL and OPENGL32.DLL from the WIN95 sub-directory on

the CD-ROM to your PC's system directory (usually C:/WIN95/SYSTEM) 

before attempting to run any of the programs.


!!! NOTICE !!! 

The source and executables in this directory are for educational purposes only,
